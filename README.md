The Ramen Review Rating Analysis Report is a project that aims to uncover insights and observations about the ramen market based on a dataset of over 2,500 ramen product reviews. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was provided by The Ramen Rater, a product review website for ramen enthusiasts.

The project began with a thorough examination of the dataset to obtain a first-hand understanding of its contents and notable observations. The dataset was then loaded into Power Query Editor to clean and transform it by removing redundancies, such as the "Top Ten*" column which had 70% unfilled fields, removing duplicates, and replacing error cells in the "Style" and "Stars" columns with the mode and mean respectively. All data types were also changed into their standard and desired format.

After cleaning and transforming the dataset, it was loaded into Jupyter Notebook for further cleaning and exploratory analysis, such as statistical analysis of the dataset, checking for duplicated and null variables, and identifying the number of unique entries in the dataset. The clean dataset was then reloaded into Excel and pivot tables and charts were created to display the desired findings.

The insights uncovered in the Ramen Review Rating Analysis Report included the dominance of Japan and South Korea in the ramen market, the unique opportunity for US companies in bar and can formats, the correlation between the variety of ramen products and the number of review ratings, and the uneven distribution of the ramen manufacturing industry internationally, with countries in Asia having a significant advantage.

Overall, the Ramen Review Rating Analysis Report provides valuable insights into the ramen market and can be useful for individuals and companies in the food industry who are interested in understanding consumer preferences and trends in this popular food category.
