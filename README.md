# Ramen-Review-Rating-Analysis
The Ramen Review Rating Analysis Report 📊 is a project  that aims to uncover insights and observations about the ramen 🍜 market based on a dataset of over *2,500* ramen product reviews. The dataset 🗃️ was sourced from [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/) and was provided by [**The Ramen Rater**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/residentmario/ramen-ratings/discussion/191547), a product 🏪 review website for ramen enthusiasts.

The project began with a thorough examination of the dataset to obtain a first-hand understanding of its contents 📦 and notable observations. The dataset was then loaded into Power Query Editor to clean 🧼 and transform  it by removing redundancies, such as the "Top Ten*" column 🧮 which had **70%** unfilled fields, removing duplicates, and replacing error cells in the **Style** and **Stars** ⭐ columns with the mode and mean respectively. All data types were also changed into their standard and desired format.

After cleaning and transforming ♻️ the dataset, it was loaded into Jupyter Notebook 🗒️ for further cleaning and exploratory analysis, such as statistical analysis 📉 of the dataset, checking for duplicated and null variables, and identifying the number  of 🔢 unique entries in the dataset. The clean dataset 🧽 was then reloaded into *Excel* and pivot tables 📋 and charts 📈 were created to display the desired findings.

The insights uncovered in the **Ramen Review Rating Analysis** Report 🖹 included the dominance of **Japan** 🗾 and **South Korea** 🇰🇷 in the ramen market 🏛️, the unique opportunity for **US** 🇺🇸 companies in bar 🍺 and can 🥫 formats, the correlation between the *variety* of ramen products🎛️ and the number of review ratings ⭐, and the uneven distribution 🥴 of the ramen manufacturing industry 🏭 internationally, with countries in *Asia* 🌏 having a significant advantage🉐.

Overall, the **Ramen Review Rating Analysis Report** 🖻 provides valuable insights into the ramen market and can be useful for individuals and companies in the food industry 🥡 who are interested in understanding consumer preferences ☺️ and trends 💹 in this popular food 🥘 category.
