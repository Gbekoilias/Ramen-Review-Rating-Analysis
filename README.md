  Ramen Rating Review Analysis
</h1>



## Aim of the project
<p style="font-size:20px;">
  The Ramen Review Rating Analysis Report 📊 is a project  that aims to uncover insights and observations about the ramen 🍜 market based on a dataset of over *2,500* ramen product reviews.
</p>

## Data Sourcing
<p style="font-size:20px;">
 The dataset 🗃️ was sourced from [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/) and was provided by [**The Ramen Rater**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/residentmario/ramen-ratings/discussion/191547), a product 🏪 review website for ramen enthusiasts.
</p>

## Data Importation, Cleaning and Exploration
<p style="font-size:20px;">
 The project began with a thorough examination of the dataset to obtain a first-hand understanding of its contents 📦 and notable observations. The dataset was then loaded into Power Query Editor to clean 🧼 and transform  it by removing redundancies, such as the "Top Ten*" column 🧮 which had **70%** unfilled fields, removing duplicates, and replacing error cells in the **Style** and **Stars** ⭐ columns with the mode and mean respectively. All data types were also changed into their standard and desired format.
</p>

## Advanced Cleaning - Python
<p style="font-size:20px;">
  After cleaning and transforming ♻️ the dataset, it was loaded into Jupyter Notebook 🗒️ for further cleaning and exploratory analysis, such as statistical analysis 📉 of the dataset, checking for duplicated and null variables, and identifying the number  of 🔢 unique entries in the dataset. The clean dataset 🧽 was then reloaded into *Excel* and pivot tables 📋 and charts 📈 were created to display the desired findings.
</p>

## Insights
<p style="font-size:20px;">
 Here are some of the conclusions I derived from the Ramen Review dataset provided
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
 1. It is clear that Japan and South Korea are the dominant producers of reviewed products, with an average review rating of 4 and 3, respectively. This indicates that these countries have a strong presence in the ramen market and may be key players in the industry.
2. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the ramen manufacturing industry is not evenly distributed internationally. In fact, the dataset reveals that countries in Asia have a significant advantage, with a 62% dominance in the reviewed ramen products. This suggests that the ramen market is heavily concentrated in this region, and that companies looking to expand globally should consider the unique challenges and opportunities of this market.
3. The analysis of the reviewed ramen products dataset indicates a strong correlation between a country's variety of ramen products and the number of review ratings it receives. This suggests that countries with a more diverse ramen market may have higher levels of consumer engagement. As such, companies operating in the ramen market should consider expanding their product lines to drive increased consumer interest and loyalty.
4. The United States is the only country that produces and sells ramen products in bar and can formats. Interestingly, these products also receive high ratings from reviewers.
This insight suggests that there may be an opportunity for companies in the United States to differentiate themselves in the ramen market by focusing on bar and can formats. Additionally, this finding may indicate a gap in the ramen market globally, with potential for growth and expansion in these specific product formats.
